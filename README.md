# 109titration_2019

A first year Epitech math project done during the 2nd semester.<br>

## Description

This program tries to find the equivalence point of a given function curve using derivatives.<br>
<br>
To process that, at first, we will do the weighted derivative of the function and estimate an equivalence point, then, do a weighted derivative of the what we obtained. To finish, if it is possible, we will take the closest points to the estimation, we did before, to be more precise about the equivalence point.<br>

## Program Input

You need to give, as input, a path to a <code>.csv</code> file.<br>
In the file, each line will sketch a point of the curve as: <code>Volume;pH</code><br>
